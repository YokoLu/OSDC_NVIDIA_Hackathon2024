# ODSC NVIDIA Hackathon 2024

With a 7-member team of international data scientists and business analysts, we made to the second round of the hackathon, ranked 8th out of 47th, at the NVIDIA Spooktacular Data Science Competition at the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) West Conference , which was sponsored by Google Cloud (also the provider for the GPU resources at the Hackathon) and NVIDIA as the main partners, on October 30, 2024. 

With access to a 10GB GPU, we processed an 8.52GB dataset containing 11 million rows and 106 features. Using 500 compute units from NVIDIA's A100 GPU (GPU CUDA), we leveraged cuDF and cuML to accelerate data processing and model training. The goal of the competition was to use linear regression and minimize RMSE to achieve fast, accurate, and precise calculations. We also used xGBoost to accelerate the process.
